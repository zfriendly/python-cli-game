# D.C. Trivia - Python CLI Game

## CLI Game Project Requirements

The game must:

* Run without errors
* Be built in Python, use a SQL database with PeeWee models


## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Knowledge of:
  - Python
  - SQL (specifically used PostgreSQL)
  - PeeWee

## My Process

1. Searched the internet for hours to find the right datasets to work with my trivia ideas, only to create my own dataset, with multiple choice questions.
2. Chose to do multiple choice instead of the easier True/False to give myself more of a challenge
3. Didn't really need pseudocode because I had already figured out the gameplay functionality.
4. Went back and forth adding to my dataset to add features such as printing the correct answer, adding new questions, etc.
5. Added flair to make the CLI game more interesting, including ASCII art and colors for the texts.


## Deployed with:

I used GitHub to host my site, which can be found [**HERE**](https://github.com/zfriendly/python-cli-game).

## Attributions

A few questions taken from [Useful Trivia](https://www.usefultrivia.com/sports_trivia/washington_nationals_trivia.html).

## Contributing/Future Additions

Feel free to find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/zfriendly) if you're interested in contributing. I had a couple of things I wanted to work on moving forward:
1) Adding more categories for trivia beyond general and sports.
2) Using a python GUI to create a prettier interface to interact with the game
3) Adding functionality to permanently add inputted questions.
